Fast api to practice in pycharm.

In this repo i use fast api to implatations a basic project and connect to sqlite DB.

In this project i worked with Postman and Insomenia, also with annotations and async, await in python.


## Comparison of Django and Fastapi

 ### 1) ORM:
 Django uses its own ORM, Django ORM, while fastapi supports various ORMs such as sqlalchemy.

 ### 2) Speed:
 Compared to Django, fastapi is much faster because it uses a return value instead of the full web framework.

 ### 3) Required hardware:
 Django requires more hardware while fastapi is very light.

 ### 4) being cooked:
 Django is considered a mature web framework, but fastapi is growing.

 ### 5) Complexity:
  Django is more complex because it does everything, while fastapi is simpler and focuses only on APIs.

 Therefore, they are very different in terms of performance and structure, and their choice depends on the needs of your project.
